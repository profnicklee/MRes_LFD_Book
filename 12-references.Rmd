When creating this book, I have used data from numerous publicly-available sources. I have also sometimes used code from publicly-available repositories and websites.

All sources are cited at the place they are used at this point, but in the future will be compiled here

Further, a number of open-access academic papers and other reports are cited or referred to in Chapters.

Weblinks are provided for all sources mentioned above where possible. However, any direct queries can be emailed to me, in case I have missed something, or perhaps a URL no longer works (all checked as of January 2024.)
